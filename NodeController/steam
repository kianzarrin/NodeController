[h1]FAQ:[/h1]
Q: Can I remove existing crossings at intersections and road transitions?
A: Yes! This is an improvement over the original "Crossings" mod. Click on road transitions you should set node type to Middle/Bend/Stretch. On junctions, you should ban pedestrian crossings and this will automatically remove crossing textures as well.

Q: I don't see the button
A: turn off Advanced Toolbar mod. Or just use the shortcut key configurable form settings (Control+N) by default.

Q: Control+N shortcut does not work for me.
A: To avoid key collisions. this only works when No other tool is active. The shortcut key is configurable from settings.

Q: How do I snap to middle nodes?
A: turn on snap to node from setttings.

Q: What is Middle/Bend/Stretch Node?
A: In vanilla game, Middle node is a node between 2 segments of the same type and is invisible. Bend node is for when road bends or asymmetrical road changes direction. 
   Using node controller you can force middle/bend nodes. Also, you can use a stretch node which stretches the textures for a better match.

Q: When I use bend node type the roads do not align.
A: Use Stretch Node. Bend node is more suited for road corners and asym roads. 

Q: I am a micro nerd but I do not know how to use corner position/direction
A: ask me directly on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.gg/4rHbBy6] Discord [/url]

Q: When I increase corner smoothness, cars glitch/slow down.
A: Increasing node size decreases segment size. if segment size is too small then cars glitch.

Q: Is this compatible with the move it?
A: its compatible with version 1.9 and above.

Q: I don't see overlays
A: need TMPE 1.5 or above

Q: I pressed hide node markings but pedestrians are still crossing.
A: Hide node markings does not actually ban crossing. You should use TMPE to ban crossing and that would automatically remove crossing textures too. Hide node markings are only useful for micro nerds to paint over their roads.
